# Movies From a Hat

> Movies From a Hat happens roughly once a month.  It's a gathering of Genesys in the RTP area to watch a movie selected at random and hangout after office hours. There is an open invitation for all employees to attend.

## The Rules

### Selecting the Movie

1. The movie is selected at random just before we watch. No one will know what the selection is until the event.
2. A movie can be removed from the list by a majority vote (but see #3)
3. You can only vote to remove a movie if you have seen it
4. A movie can be tabled to be watched later by a majority vote.
5. Anyone can vote to table a movie .
6. A vote to remove also counts as a vote to table.
7. Be reasonable. If somebody's uncomfortable watching something, or finds it offensive, just skip it.

### Adding movies to the list

1. Anyone can add movies to the list.
2. Movies can be added to the list by opening a PR to edit `src/MovieList.elm` (don't forget to add an image in `posters/`)
3. We're looking for movies that flew under the radar, not blockbusters. (Think "Krull", not "Lord of the Rings")
4. Use common sense. You'll be watching this with your co-workers. Be mindful of them and the power differentials that exist in the workspace.
5. No Troma Films. (The Cheely Rule)
