# Movies From a Hat

> Movies From a Hat happens roughly once a month. It's a gathering of Genesys in
> the RTP area to watch a movie selected at random and hangout after office
> hours. There is an open invitation for all employees to attend.

## The Rules

### Selecting the Movie

1. The movie is selected at random just before we watch. No one will know what
   the selection is until the event.
2. A movie can be removed from the list by a majority vote (but see #3)
3. You can only vote to remove a movie if you have seen it
4. A movie can be tabled to be watched later by a majority vote.
5. Anyone can vote to table a movie.
6. A vote to remove also counts as a vote to table.
7. Review the rating & content warnings for the movie. Anyone can veto a movie
   for content. <sup>\*</sup>

<sup>\*</sup>If a movie is vetoed for content, even if it was your favorite
movie ever, please keep your disappointment to yourself. Even in jest, this can
make people feel like they're not welcome because they're "spoiling the fun"

### Adding movies to the list

1. Anyone can add movies to the list.
2. Movies can be added to the list via a PR against the
   [git repo](https://github.com/MoviesFromAHat/MoviesFromAHat.github.io/)
3. We're looking for movies that flew under the radar, not blockbusters. (Think
   "Krull", not "Lord of the Rings")
4. Use common sense. You'll be watching this with your co-workers. Be mindful of
   them and the power differentials that exist in the workspace.
5. No Troma Films. (The Cheely Rule)
